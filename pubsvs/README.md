# IRIS Release Video Pages

These pages were used to display custom videos that the IRIS team put together for features. These pages were made and hosted by IRIS, and sent out with a correlating IRIS link.

### [Original Video Page](https://dejai.github.io/iris_bros/pubsvs/videoPage_original.html) & [Reponsive Video Page](https://dejai.github.io/iris_bros/pubsvs/videoPage_responsive.html)
> Date: May, 2016 <br/><br/>
> Description: The original page was not responsive, and the video was larger than the screen. The responsive version addressed that issue. <br/><br/>
> NOTE: The original was done by Valery Viner, and I simply worked on making it a bit more responsive.

### [Release Notes](https://dejai.github.io/iris_bros/pubsvs/releaseNotes.html)
> Date: August, 2017 <br/><br/>
> Description: This page was intended to be a temporary place for us to host our release notes. This was instead of being directly in emails.

----

### [Signups Page](https://dejai.github.io/iris_bros/pubsvs/signups.html)
> Date: August, 2017 <br/><br/>
> Description: This page is an updated version of the page to take signups to the IRIS list. It was never used as it was not a high priority.

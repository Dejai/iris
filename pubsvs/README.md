# IRIS Release Video Pages

These pages were used to display custom videos that the IRIS team put together for features. These pages were made and hosted by IRIS, and sent out with a correlating IRIS link.

### [Original](https://dejai.github.io/iris_bros/pubsvs/videoPage_original.html) & [Reponsive](https://dejai.github.io/iris_bros/pubsvs/videoPage_responsive.html)
> Date: May, 2016 <br/><br/>
> Description: The original page was not responsive, and the video was larger than the screen. The responsive version addressed that issue. <br/><br/>
> NOTE: The original was done by Valery Viner, and I simply worked on making it a bit more responsive.

<h2>The Email Generator Gadget (EGG)</h2>
<p>This tool was created as a way to simplify and streamline email communication with IRIS users. Simply pick the affiliate(s) and the topic, then generate an email shell with the appropriate email addresses included in the TO and CC fields.</p>
<p> Below is a <strong>replica</strong> of the original tool. The names of the affiliate's and the individuals have been changed for demo purposes</p>

<div>
	<h3> Customer Table</h3>
	<p>The tool above is based on a table of information for each person at an affiliate</p>
	<button id="toggleCustomerTable">Show/Hide Table</button>
</div>
<div id="tableContainer"></div>
	<p>If I don't want to worry about the crazy logic of the ATM, I could just include the code on Github. And then just describe it's intended behavior.</p>

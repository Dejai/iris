# The Email Generator Gadget (EGG)

This tool was created as a way to simplify and streamline our email communication with our users. Often times, we would have to ask ourselves "if I am emailing [enter_group_name], who should I include in the email?" Furthermore, this answer would change based on the topic you were emailing about. 

The EGG allowed you to pick the affiliate(s) and the topic, and simply click a button to generate an email shell with the appropriate email addresses included in the TO and CC fields.

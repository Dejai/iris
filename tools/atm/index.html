<h2>The Affiliate Table Manager (ATM)</h2>
	
<p>This tool was created as a way to easily manage the users and topics in the table of users that was used with <a href="../egg" target="_blank"> The Email Generator Gadget EGG) </a>. Using this tool, users could ensure that the information for each user was consistent with the table structure.</p>

<p> Below is a button that serves as a <strong>replica</strong> of the tool. It works with the customer table that is also included below. Please keep in mind that this was originally designed to work in a Confluence page, and was included on the same page as <a href="../egg" target="_blank"> The Email Generator Gadget EGG) </a></p>

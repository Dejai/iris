# The Affiliate Table Manager (ATM)

This tool was created as a way to simplify and streamline our email communication with our users. Often times, we would have to ask ourselves "if I am emailing [enter_group_name], who should I include in the email?" Furthermore, this answer would change based on the topic you were emailing about. 

The EGG allowed you to pick the affiliate(s) and the topic, and simply click a button to generate an email shell with the appropriate email addresses included in the TO and CC fields.

	
This tool was created as a way to easily manage the users and topics in the table of users that was used with [The Email Generator Gadget (EGG)](../egg). Using this tool, users could ensure that the information for each user was consistent with the table structure.

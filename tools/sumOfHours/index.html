<h1> Sum Of Hours</h1>
<p> This tool was created as a way to easily summarize the number of hours logged for our development tickets. It organized the hours into different categories that the product manager was interested in seeing.</p>

<p> Below is a <strong>replica</strong> of the tool, which was originally created as a bookmarklet. Click <a href="./src.js">here</a> to see the original bookmarklet code.</p>

# Expand And Collapse

The "Expand and Collapse" tool was originally built as a simple JavaScript tool and added to pages in our team Confluence Wiki space. The purpose of this tool was to supplement the "Expand" macro that Confluence provided. This allowed you to add content to a page in an element that was hidden by default. Upon clicking the associated link, it would expand or collapse the content. 

This macro was convenient in helping to make a large amount of data presentable. However, there did not seem to be a way to expand all sections at once. So, I worked on this tool to do just that - expand and collapse multiple "Expand" macros on a Confluence page.

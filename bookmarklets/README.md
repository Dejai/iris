# [Append](https://dejai.github.com/iris_bros/bookmarklets/appendParams.js)
This code can be used to append a sessionID & a useful "success" URL to Magento order domains.
During testing, the Magento order domain structure was as follows: http://ecomm-mag-t1.agora.local/[name_of_page]
Magento order domains can only be accessed fromo on the internal network.

# Bookmarklets
The following are some bookmarklets that I created to provide some assistance with some team tasks. These were my own initiative and provided some benefit in streamlining and simplifying some of our team needs.

# [Sum of Hours](https://dejai.github.com/iris_bros/bookmarklets/sumOfHours.js)
This code can be used to summarize the hours logged for billable time based on the categories we've agreed to. 

# [Append](https://dejai.github.com/iris_bros/bookmarklets/appendParams.js)
This code can be used to append a sessionID & a useful "success" URL to Magento order domains.
During testing, the Magento order domain structure was as follows: http://ecomm-mag-t1.agora.local/[name_of_page]
Magento order domains can only be accessed fromo on the internal network. 

# [Generate JQL](https://dejai.github.com/iris_bros/bookmarklets/generateJQL.js)
This bookmarklet can be used to generate a query for JIRA in JQL (JIRA Query Language). This query is a way to find all the tickets within a given Epic (in the form of an issue key). It will also return any related Epics and the tickets within those related Epics.

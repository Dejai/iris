			<h3>Redesigned Effort Search Panel</h3>
			<p>The new search panel on the effort listings screen will allow you to view applied filters, add or remove filters, exclude search criteria, and search for multiple criteria at once. The "Start New Search" option lets you search across all efforts in the system. You can save your search results at any time using the "My Filters" functionality. </p>
			<h3>Redirect and Placeholder Details in Trees</h3>
			<p>The tree visual on the effort screen now includes redirects. If you expire a page or offer, the tree will show the page, offer, or URL that creative is redirecting to. If you have effort-level redirects on your effort, the tree will indicate when the "Primary Redirect", "Secondary Redirect", or "Redirect to Order Form" options are used. <br/><br/> The tree will also show connections between creatives if an ad, page, or abandon email includes full promotion, HTML_URL, or order form placeholders.</p>
			<h3>Improvements to Testing Group Details</h3>
			<p>Testing group details now include all columns that are available on schedules. When you view efforts in a subgroup, the subgroup totals will display at the bottom of each subgroup. Use the new "Show Selected Only" option to show only the efforts and subgroups you're interested in viewing.</p>
			<h3>Abandon Email Series is Here</h3>
			<p>You can now set up a series of abandon emails and customize the delay between them. If a customer clicks the order form link in one of the abandon emails in the series, they will not receive the remaining emails. There are some compliance considerations involved with this feature such as allowing a customer to unsubscribe from future emails. Please keep this in mind when using this feature.</p>
			<h3>New Global Code Management Page</h3>
			<p>Users with the "Create Global Code" permission can now manage global code on the Global Codes page. This page will show you all global code definitions, specify what domain configurations are using the code, and allow you to add, edit, or remove code. You can still manage global code on each domain configuration.</p>
			<h3>Global Code Applied to Creative Preview</h3>
			<p>You can now apply global code to a creative preview on the Creative Review tab. This will allow you to see how things like scripts, footers, etc. interact with the rest of the page without creating an effort.</p>
			<h3>Simplified Agora and Non-Agora Effort Workflow</h3>
			<p>We realized that Agora and Non-Agora page creatives were an unnecessary step in creating external efforts, therefore you no longer need to create them. Simply enter the ad creative and the partner's link on those efforts. Existing efforts and related ad creatives will be unaffected.</p>
